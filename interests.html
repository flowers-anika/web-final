    <h3>My favorite pastimes:</h3>
    <p>My favorite pastimes (in order) are drawing, playing video games, and playing piano. My favorite medium is arcrylics. I try to paint in realism from pictureso the internet.

       <p>Marikyuun's style is sooo cute, and the trick is to draw "thick lines on the outside and thin lines on the inside".</p>
